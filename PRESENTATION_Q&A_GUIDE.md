# BizSathi Presentation Q&A Guide

## üéØ Quick System Overview (30 seconds)

**BizSathi** is a comprehensive shopkeeper business management system with:
- **Frontend**: React Native Expo app (mobile-first)
- **Backend**: Node.js server with SQLite database
- **AI Services**: Python Flask API for credit scoring
- **Blockchain**: Immutable sales records
- **Scanner**: Barcode scanning for inventory

---

## üîß Technical Architecture Questions

### Q: How do the three services communicate?
**A**: 
- **Frontend ‚Üî Backend**: HTTP REST API (port 3001)
- **Backend ‚Üî Python AI**: HTTP requests to Flask API (port 5000)
- **Real-time updates**: Context providers manage state across the app

### Q: What's the data flow for a typical transaction?
**A**:
1. User scans barcode ‚Üí Frontend sends to Backend
2. Backend updates SQLite database
3. Backend adds record to blockchain
4. Backend calls Python API for credit score update
5. Frontend receives updated data via Context

### Q: How does the credit scoring work?
**A**:
- **Python AI Service** calculates scores based on:
  - Transaction volume and frequency
  - Payment reliability
  - Profit margins
  - Business growth patterns
- **Dynamic updates**: Score changes with each transaction
- **Risk levels**: Excellent (800+), Good (700-799), Fair (600-699), etc.

## üì± Frontend Questions

### Q: How is the app structured?
**A**:
- **Tab Navigation**: 5 main screens (Dashboard, Inventory, Scanner, Blockchain, History)
- **Context Providers**: AuthContext, DataContext, ScanContext, BlockchainContext
- **Services**: apiService.ts for HTTP calls, creditScoreService.ts for calculations

### Q: How does the scanner work?
**A**:
- **Expo Camera** with barcode detection
- **Visual feedback**: Blue border (ready), green border (scanning)
- **Dual mode**: Add items (Inventory tab) vs Remove items (Scanner tab)
- **Auto-navigation**: Directs to product action forms

### Q: How is state managed?
**A**:
- **React Context** for global state (auth, data, scanner, blockchain)
- **AsyncStorage** for persistent login tokens
- **Real-time updates** across all screens
